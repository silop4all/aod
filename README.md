
# Assistance On Demand service Infrastructure (AoD)

The Assistance on Demand (AoD) is a generic open-source web platform that enables the rapid deployment of machine/human/crowd-based assistance services on demand by allowing service suppliers to easily register their assistance service and individuals to seek assistance in an organized fashion from a set of predefined (i.e. already registered) service sources based on type of need, quality of service desired, and other personal preferences. 
The AoD platform particularly focuses on solving accessibility challenges for people with disabilities and enables matching service providers to service consumers.

- [Step 1: Install dependencies and AoD project](#step-1-install-dependencies-and-aod)
- [Step 2: AoD project settings](#step-2-aod-project-settings)
- [Step 3: Generate & populate the AoD database](#step-3-generate-populate-the-aod-database)
- [Step 4: Enable Apache configuration of AoD project](#step-4-enable-apache-configuration-of-aod-project)

---------

### Minumum hardware requirements

- `RAM`: 2 GB
- `CPU cores`: > 1
- `Disk space`: > 20 GB

The AoD project has been deployed and tested in both linux environment (`Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04`) and `Windows 8/10`.


### Step 1: Install dependencies and AoD

- Relational Database Management system (MySQL or PostgreSQL)
- Apache web server
- Python 2.7

<!-- In case that you plan to deploy the AoD project in a __Ubuntu VM 14.04__, you can skip this step by executing the [installation script](""). Otherwise, follow the instructions below. -->


#### Resolve host
```shell
$ sudo sh -c "echo \"127.0.0.1\" $HOSTNAME >> /etc/hosts"
```

#### Create group & user
```bash
$ sudo groupadd aod
$ sudo useradd aod -g aod -s /bin/bash
```

#### Update VM
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

#### Install basic packages
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip git unzip vim
```

#### Install MySQL server and create a database
Be sure to set a root password to avoid problems.
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server python-mysqldb libmysqlclient-dev
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation   
$ sudo service mysql restart       
$ sudo service mysql status  
```

```bash
$ sudo mysql -uroot -p
```
```sql
create database `aod` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci; 
create user 'aod'@'localhost' identified by 'aod';       
grant all privileges on `aod`.* to 'aod'@'localhost'; 
flush privileges;
quit
```

#### Install Apache web server
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-python libapache2-mod-wsgi rcconf dialog
$ sudo apachectl status 
$ sudo service apache2 restart 
```


#### Install image packages
```bash
$ sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging
$ sudo apt-get install libjpeg8 libjpeg62-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev
```


#### Install python packages
The python packages must be installed given that python with version 2.7 has already pre-installed in Ubuntu 14.04. The VM administrator needs to install the python pip package. To check the version of the python as well as the installed python packages, the VM administrator can use:
```bash
$ sudo python -V
$ sudo pip freeze
```


#### Install the AoD project
Deploy the AoD project including its applications:
```bash
$ sudo mkdir /opt/prosperity/
$ cd /home/ubuntu/
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/silop4all/aod.git
$ cd /opt/prosperity/
$ sudo cp /home/ubuntu/aod/* /opt/prosperity/
$ sudo chown aod:aod -R /opt/prosperity/
$ sudo find /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
$ sudo find /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
$ sudo chmod -R 775 /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/media
$ sudo chmod -R 777 /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/logs
```

Then, install the packages included in ```requirements.txt``` using the command:
```bash
$ cd /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt 
```


#### Configurate the Apache web server
As aforementioned, the Django runserver should be used only for testing or during the development phase. To solve it, the Apache web server must be configured as so AoD platform be accessible. In principle, disable the default configuration and create a new one.

```shell
$ cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
$ sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/aod.conf
$ sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
$ sudo service apache2 restart

$ sudo vim aod.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
        # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
        # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
        
        ServerName www.example.com
        ServerAdmin root@localhost.com
        DocumentRoot /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand

        # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
        # error, crit, alert, emerg.
        # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
        # modules, e.g.
        #LogLevel info ssl:warn

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
        # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
        # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
        # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
        # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
        #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
</VirtualHost>
```


```shell
$ cd /etc/apache2/
$ sudo vim http.conf
# If the debug mode is True:
WSGIScriptAlias / /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/AssistanceOnDemand/wsgi.py
WSGIPythonPath /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/AssistanceOnDemand/

# In production mode the media must be served from apache web server. Therefore, uncomment the next block if configuration.
# The default path is /. In case that path  /prosperity/assistance-on-demand/, see below:  
#
# Alias /prosperity/assistance-on-demand/static /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/static
# Alias /prosperity/assistance-on-demand/media /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/media
# 
# <Directory /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/static>
#     Require all granted
# </Directory>
# 
# <Directory /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/media>
#     Require all granted
# </Directory>
#
# End of block

<Directory /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/AssistanceOnDemand>
    <Files wsgi.py>
        #Order deny,allow
        Require all granted
    </Files>
</Directory>
```

```shell
$ cd /etc/apache2/
$ sudo vim apache2.conf
# Include aod configuration at the end of file
Include /etc/apache2/http.conf
```




#### Step 2: AoD project settings

You need to modify the ```wsgi.py``` as follows:
```bash
$ cd /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/AssistanceOnDemand/
$ vim wsgi.py
import os
# Uncomment the following lines
import sys
sys.path.append('/opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand')
sys.path.append('/opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/AssistanceOnDemand')
...
```

The settings of the AoD project consists of the main file called ```settings.py``` and two others files, the ```development_settings.py``` and the ```production_settings.py```. Since you have set the operation mode fo the project (see ```PRODUCTION``` variable in the settings.py file), you need to set a few variables. All files are located to the path ```/opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/AssistanceOnDemand```.

The __variables__ that you must define in `settings.py` are the following:

##### PRODUCTION
Define if you plan to use the AoD project for production or development purpose. 

__Type__: `Boolean`

__Default__: `False`

$ sudo chown aod:aod -R /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/
$ sudo mysql -uaod -paod aod < /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/sql/aod_data.sql
```

Execute the command to detect if the installation of AoD project has been performed successfully or not:
```bash
$ cd /opt/prosperity/AssistanceOnDemand/
$ sudo python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
```

> You can check the correct installation of AoD using the command: 
> - curl -vvv http://localhost:8080/en/ from another terminal or via the browser (Chrome, Firefox)


#### Step 4: Enable Apache configuration of AoD project

```shell
$ sudo a2ensite aod.conf
$ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi
$ sudo a2enmod wsgi
$ sudo service apache2 restart
```


## Install PhpMyAdmin (optional)

Use the following commands to install the PhpMyAdmin (served by Apache web server). 

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
$ sudo service apache2 restart
$ sudo php5enmod mcrypt
$ sudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf-available/phpmyadmin.conf
$ sudo a2enconf phpmyadmin.conf
$ sudo service apache2 restart
```

```bash
$ sudo vim /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
# phpMyAdmin default Apache configuration

# add prefix i.e. /prosperity/assistance-on-demand
Alias /prosperity/assistance-on-demand/phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin

<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin>
        Options FollowSymLinks
        DirectoryIndex index.php

        <IfModule mod_php5.c>
                AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

                php_flag magic_quotes_gpc Off
                php_flag track_vars On
                php_flag register_globals Off
                php_admin_flag allow_url_fopen Off
                php_value include_path .
                php_admin_value upload_tmp_dir /var/lib/phpmyadmin/tmp
                php_admin_value open_basedir /usr/share/phpmyadmin/:/etc/phpmyadmin/:/var/lib/phpmyadmin/:/usr/share/php/php-gettext/:/usr/share/javascript/
        </IfModule>

</Directory>

# Authorize for setup
<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin/setup>
    <IfModule mod_authn_file.c>
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "phpMyAdmin Setup"
    AuthUserFile /etc/phpmyadmin/htpasswd.setup
    </IfModule>
    Require valid-user
</Directory>

# Disallow web access to directories that don't need it
<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries>
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from All
</Directory>
<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin/setup/lib>
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from All
</Directory>
```

```bash
$ sudo service apache2 reload
```


In phppmyadmin UI must have access only authenticated users; to achieve it, the folder must be password protected as follows:

```bash
$ cd /usr/share/phpmyadmin/
$ sudo vim .htaccess
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Password Protected Area"
    AuthUserFile /etc/phpmyadmin/.htpasswd
    Require valid-user


$ sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
$ cd /etc/phpmyadmin/
$ sudo htpasswd -c /etc/phpmyadmin/.htpasswd {username}
$ (enter password)
$ sudo vim /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf

Alias /prosperity/assistance-on-demand/phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin

<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin>
    AllowOverride AuthConfig
    Options FollowSymLinks
    DirectoryIndex index.php
    ....
</Directory>

$ sudo service apache2 restart
```
